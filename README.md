# AI-Powered Content Creation - `research.py`
This project leverages **Google Gemini APIs** and **LangChain** to automate the content creation process. The solution includes three distinct AI agents—**Content Planner**, **Content Writer**, and **Editor**—which work together to plan, write, and edit SEO-optimized blog posts based on user-provided topics.

Built with **Streamlit**, the app enables users to input a topic and generates a comprehensive content plan, a well-written blog post, and an edited version, streamlining the content creation workflow for efficient and high-quality results.
## How It Works
1. **Input Topic**: Users provide a topic to begin the content generation process.
2. **Content Generation**: The **Content Planner** creates an outline, followed by the **Content Writer** drafting the blog post.
3. **Content Refining**: The **Editor** ensures the blog post aligns with journalistic standards and is free of grammatical errors.
4. **Output**: The final blog post is displayed on Streamlit for review and publication.
